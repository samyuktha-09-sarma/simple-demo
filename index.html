Hi, I’m Samyuktha dedicated student with a strong interest in computer science and 
web technologies. I enjoy working on creative and practical projects using HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, and backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB. I'm passionate about 
learning how modern tech like cloud storage, AI, and biometric authentication works, 
and I’m constantly building and exploring new ideas to expand my skills. With a curious mind 
and a hands-on approach, I aim to develop innovative solutions that are both useful and user-friendly.
